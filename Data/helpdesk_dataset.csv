Firewalls and VPNs are two different security tools that can be used together to enhance security. Firewalls can be hardware or software-based, while VPNs are typically software-based. Firewalls are typically used to block malicious traffic, while VPNs are used to encrypt internet traffic. ",Network Security,Intermediate
How do I properly dispose of old computer hardware?,"Proper disposal of old computer hardware is crucial to prevent identity theft and data breaches. First, remove all personal data from the device by wiping it or destroying the hard drive. Then, remove any removable media such as batteries and SIM cards. Next, remove any magnetic storage devices such as hard drives and SSDs. If the device has a CD or DVD drive, remove any discs. Finally, dispose of the device in a secure manner such as a secure e-waste recycling facility. Do not simply throw it away in the trash, as this can allow unauthorized individuals to access the device and steal sensitive information. ",Data Backup and Recovery,Basic
What is the difference between a virus and a Trojan horse?,"A virus is a type of malware that replicates itself by attaching to other programs on a computer. It is designed to cause harm to a computer system. A Trojan horse is a type of malware that appears to be harmless but actually contains malicious code. It is designed to trick users into installing it on their computer. Once installed, the Trojan horse can allow hackers to access the computer and steal sensitive information. Viruses and Trojan horses are two different types of malware that can cause harm to a computer system. ",Malware Protection,Intermediate
How do I create a strong password?,"To create a strong password, use a combination of characters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information such as your name, birthdate, or common words. Use a passphrase, which is a series of words that is easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess. Use a password manager to generate and store unique, complex passwords for each of your online accounts. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts. Change your password regularly, ideally every 60 to 90 days. ",Authentication,Intermediate
What is a disaster recovery plan?,"A disaster recovery plan is a plan that outlines the procedures to be followed in case of a disaster or a major disruption to business operations. It should include steps to recover data, systems, and facilities in the event of a disaster. The plan should be regularly tested and updated to ensure it is effective. A disaster recovery plan should include procedures for data backup and restoration, communication with employees and stakeholders, and business continuity. It should also include a plan for emergency response and recovery. ",Incident Response,Intermediate
How do I secure my mobile device?,"To secure your mobile device, use a strong lock screen password or PIN. Enable two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security. Use a mobile security app to scan for malware and viruses. Keep your device and apps up to date with the latest security patches. Be cautious when downloading and installing apps, and only download from trusted sources. Use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic when using public Wi-Fi. Use a case or cover that protects your screen and prevents unauthorized access. ",Mobile Security,Intermediate
How do I protect my organization's sensitive data from unauthorized access during a ransomware attack?,"To protect sensitive data from unauthorized access during a ransomware attack, implement a robust backup strategy. This includes storing backups offline, such as on external hard drives or cloud storage, and regularly testing backups to ensure they can be restored quickly. Additionally, consider implementing a data encryption solution to protect data at rest and in transit. Regularly update software and operating systems to patch vulnerabilities and use strong antivirus software to prevent malware from executing. Educate employees on the importance of not opening suspicious emails or attachments and using strong passwords.",Incident Response,Intermediate
What are the common types of malware?,"There are several types of malware, including viruses, Trojans, spyware, ransomware, and adware. Viruses replicate and spread by attaching themselves to other programs or files, while Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software to gain unauthorized access to a system. Spyware collects user data without consent, ransomware demands payment in exchange for restoring access to encrypted data, and adware displays unwanted ads to generate revenue. To protect against malware, keep software up-to-date, use antivirus software, and avoid suspicious downloads and attachments.",Malware Protection,Intermediate
How do I reset my router's password?,"To reset your router's password, locate the small button usually found on the back or bottom of the device. Press and hold the button with a paper clip or pin until the lights on the router start flashing. Release the button and wait for the router to restart. The default IP address is 192.168.0.1, so navigate to this address in your web browser. Change the admin password and save the changes to secure your network. Make sure to write down the new password for future reference.",Network Security,Basic
What is the difference between a firewall and antivirus software?,"A firewall monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic to block unauthorized access to your system, while antivirus software detects and removes malware. Firewalls act as a barrier between your system and the internet, preventing hackers from accessing your network. Antivirus software, on the other hand, scans your system for malware and removes it to prevent damage. Both are essential components of a robust cybersecurity defense.",Network Security,Intermediate
How do I create a disaster recovery plan?,"A disaster recovery plan involves identifying critical business processes, creating backups of essential data, and establishing procedures for restoring systems and operations in case of a disaster. Identify potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them. Develop a business impact analysis to determine which systems and data are most critical. Create a recovery team and establish communication protocols to ensure everyone knows their roles and responsibilities. Regularly test and update the plan to ensure it remains effective.",Data Backup and Recovery,Advanced
What are the best practices for secure mobile device use?,"To ensure secure mobile device use, use a password or PIN lock to protect your device. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to require a second form of verification, such as a fingerprint or code sent to your email. Regularly update your device and apps to patch security vulnerabilities. Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities, and use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.",Mobile Security,Intermediate
